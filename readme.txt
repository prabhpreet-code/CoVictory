``Explain your inspiration—

As we are again experiencing a surge in covid-19 cases it becomes vital for us to remember precautions so that together we can defeat covid-19.
Covid-19 has caused a lot of devastation in the past few years!
We don’t want to repeat that mistakes! Do we?
According to reports, nearly 66% of people around the globe are not taking enough precautions against covid-19. 

Therefore, we have built a website named CoVictory which means together we can achieve Victory over Covid-19.
This website is a Memory game that will check and improve your memory and along with that, you will learn all the precautions to fight with covid-19.
Together we win, we survive!

What it does?
This website sharpens your memory and reminds the basic precautions that should be taken against the rise in covid-19.
Our website offers four different modes to challenge your memory skills.

``How we build it?
•	The frontend is built with Tailwind, Html5, Css3
•	Backend is built using Vanilla JavaScript.
•	We managed our code using Git, GitHub
•	 All images are made using Adobe-Illustrator and Adobe-Premier Pro
 


```Challenges we ran into?
•	The main obstacle we faced was implementing the flipping effect of the cards.
•	The image on the cards were taking a lot of time to load. So, we came up with a solution to resize the resolution of images.
•	We faced difficulties in making the website responsive thoroughly.




```Accomplishments that we’re proud of 

Our greatest accomplishment was to implement the knowledge that we have learned from past MLH hackathons and build a fun website. 



```What we learn?
•	As our vanilla JavaScript skills were a bit rusty but by building this project, we were able to sharpen/polish our skills. 
•	By taking part in MLH hackathons we were able to learn how to work in a team.



```What’s next for CoVictory?
•	Further we are thinking to make a play again button to improve the user experience.
•	We are also thinking to implement dark and light mode.
•	We are also thinking to add different themes on the social cause to provide knowledge to the user.
